For AI-Bot Competition, we develop intelligent voice assistants like Alexa and Amazon's voice assistant and I collaborate with hardware and software groups.
As a member of the hardware group, I helped develop microcontrollers to detect and record voice and play it back after processing. Since I like AI, I also tried to collaborate with a software group and we worked on building NLP models for bots.

The bot answers questions via voice after receiving a call, followed by answers to weather, time, date, and occasion questions.
